## Hi, im Heikon Costa ðŸ˜Š

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm currently diving into programming, with a special focus on web development. As a System Development student at Etec Lauro Gomes, I'm always exploring new areasâ€”front-end, back-end, algorithms, and databasesâ€”to level up my skills. ðŸš€

For now, I'm working on personal projects, but my goal is to master web development and be part of amazing projects (including my own!).
